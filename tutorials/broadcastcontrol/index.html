<h1>Start/Stop Broadcast</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  XSplit now allows users the ability to Start or Stop a Broadcast through the framework
  and Pause or Unpause a Local Recording. This will be really useful for things such as Scheduled
  Streaming.
</p>

<h3>How to Start your Broadcast</h3>
<p>
  Before one can start broadcasting, you should know your available Output Channels
  and which ones you want to start broadcasting to.
</p>

<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
// get necessary classes
var xjs = require('xjs');
var Output = xjs.Output;

xjs.ready()
  .then(Output.getOutputList)
  .then(function(outputs) {
    outputs.map(output => {
      output.getName()
      .then(function(name) {
        if(name.includes('Twitch')) {
          output.startBroadcast();
        }
      })
    })
  })

</code></pre>
<p>
  This will provide you an array of all the Output instance that's available/installed on your
  XSplit Broadcaster. You can then continue to select which instance you would like to
  start or stop broadcasting to.
</p>
<p>
  Once you've selected the output instance you want to start broadcasting to. You can just
  immediately start/stop the broadcast from there.
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
  output.startBroadcast();
  // or
  output.stopBroadcast();
</code></pre>
<p>
  Additionally, if you're only on a Local Recording, you can choose to call <strong><code>output.pauseLocalRecording()</code></strong> or <strong><code>output.unpauseLocalRecording()</code></strong> to pause/unpause the
  local recording.
</p>

<div class="warning">
  <h3><span id='warning'>&#9888;</span>Current Limitation</h3>
  <p>
    Output plugins such as YouTube or Facebook that has pre streaming dialogs, would still need to be set-up manually. Any other output plugins would work immediately using the predefined configuration the user has saved initially.
  </p>
</div>
