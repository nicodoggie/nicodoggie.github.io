<h1>Common Errors</h1>
<p>Before you start coding, you need to know how the application performs its work, in order to avoid any weird errors.</p>

<h2>Sources in memory</h2>
<p>Sources are not kept loaded in memory by default. Every time a user switches scenes, the current set of sources is unloaded (except for those configured to be kept loaded), which can lead to issues such as a stopwatch resetting to 0. The new scene's sources will then be loaded into memory.</p>
<p>The caveat with sources that are not loaded is that while it is possible to get a listing of all items through the <code>getItems()</code> call of a <code>Scene</code>, it is (currently) not possible to get or set any of its properties (with the exception of the <code>getID()</code> and <code>getSceneID()</code> calls).</p>
<p>To get around this restriction, you may either set the sources to be always kept in memory, or only manipulate sources if they are in the currently active scene.</p>

<h2>Extensions handling multiple scenes</h2>
<p>For performance purposes, not all scenes are initialized when the application runs. On application startup, it initializes only those scenes starting from Scene 1, all the way to the currently active scene or the last scene containing a source, whichever is later. Extensions that try to manipulate these uninitialized scenes will possibly encounter errors when using the Scene class.</p>
<p>The safest way to avoid this is to call <code>Scene.initializeScenes()</code>, which will initialize all the scenes in the application. (As an added note, <code>Scene.setActiveScene()</code> will also perform initialization for all scenes up to and including the target scene.)</p>
