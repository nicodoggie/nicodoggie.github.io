<h1>Common Errors</h1>
<p>Before you start coding, you need to know how the application performs its work, in order to avoid any weird errors.</p>

<h2>Sources in memory</h2>
<p>Sources are not kept loaded in memory by default. Every time a user switches scenes, the current set of sources is unloaded (except for those configured to be kept loaded), which can lead to issues such as a stopwatch resetting to 0. The new scene's sources will then be loaded into memory.</p>
<p>The caveat with sources that are not loaded is that while it is possible to get a listing of all items through the <code>getItems()</code> call of a <code>Scene</code>, it is (currently) not possible to get or set any of its properties (with the exception of the <code>getID()</code> and <code>getSceneID()</code> calls).</p>
<p>To get around this restriction, you may either set the sources to be always kept in memory, or only manipulate sources if they are in the currently active scene.</p>
<p>As an additional note, currently all global sources are set to be kept in memory.</p>

<h2>Pages not refreshing</h2>
<p>Running into caching issues while testing? Try adding a query parameter (<code>test.html?random=0</code>) to your page's URL. TODO: check if there is anything more we can say about this; such as when caching issues might occur, anything about manually refreshing, etc.</p>
