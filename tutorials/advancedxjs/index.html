<h1>Installing XJS - Advanced</h1>

<p>
  Instead of creating your HTML and JS files from scratch as described in <a href="quickstart.html">Quick Start</a>, there are still other ways
  you can install xjs in your projects. You can select any of the following methods:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#/advancedxjs#yeoman">Scaffold a project with Yeoman</a></li>
  <li><a href="#/advancedxjs#npm">Dependency management with npm</a></li>
  <li><a href="#/advancedxjs#bower">Dependency management with Bower</a></li>
  <li><a href="#/advancedxjs#zipfile">Start from a zip file</a></li>
  <li><a href="#/advancedxjs#cdn">Direct link to hosted cdn file</a></li>
</ul>

  <h2>Scaffold a project with Yeoman</h2>
</a>
<h3>Dependencies</h3>
<p>
  You'll need to have Node.js and npm installed first.
  If you have that installed already, great! If not,
  you should go to the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">
  official website</a>, download and install it.
  Also, do make sure that you have the latest version of npm
  to avoid issues with other tools.
  Finally, you will need <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">Git</a> on your machine.
</p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>
  Let's get started first with installing yeoman and XSplit JS Framework generator through npm.
</p>
<pre class="language-shell"><code>npm install -g bower
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-xjs</code></pre>
<p>
  That will allow you to generate XSplit JS Framework based projects through the command <code>yo xjs</code>.
</p>
<p>
  To use our generator, you'll have to create your project folder, and then scaffold your project in there:
</p>
<pre class="language-shell"><code>mkdir YOUR_DIR
cd YOUR_DIR
yo xjs</code></pre>
<p>
  You will be prompted with a number of options like project name, version, plugin type, and package name.
</p>
<p>
  That should create the basic structure for your plugin, including a generic HTML file you can use to get started. The directory should now also include the file <code>xjs.js</code>, which contains the framework code. We also included <code>browsersync</code> for you to test your plugin on a browser first; all you have to do is execute <code>gulp</code> in the root folder of your project. This serves your plugin at <code>http://localhost:9001</code>, and watches your code for changes so it can automatically refresh your HTML.
</p>

<a id="npm" name="npm">
  <h2>Dependency management with npm</h2>
</a>
<p>
  Usage of npm is straightforward.
</p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>
  Assuming npm is installed, just execute this in your command line:
</p>
<pre class="language-shell"><code>npm install xjs-framework</code></pre>
<p>
  This would create a <code>node_modules</code> folder. The relevant file is <code>node_modules/xjs-framework/dist/xjs.js</code>, which you should include in your plugin's HTML file. All other details of the project structure are up to you.
</p>
<p>
  This approach also opens up an alternative coding method. You can create your plugins using TypeScript or ES2015 if desired. To learn more, see <a href="tutorials.html#/es6" target="_blank">our tutorials</a>.
</p>

<a id="bower" name="bower">
  <h2>Dependency management with Bower</h2>
</a>
<p>
  Our Yeoman Generator also makes use of Bower, but the generator simply executes it automatically.
</p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>
  To use bower, install it first, and then fetch <code>xjs-framework</code> through bower.
</p>
<pre class="language-shell"><code>npm install -g bower
bower install xjs-framework</code></pre>
<p>
<p>
  This creates a <code>bower_components</code> folder. The relevant file is <code>bower_components/xjs-framework/dist/xjs.js</code>, which you should include in your plugin's HTML file. All other details of the project structure are up to you. See the following example for what a basic plugin might look like.
</p>
<h4>Example:</h4>
<pre class="language-markup"><code>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;script src="bower_components/xjs-framework/dist/xjs.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script src="js/main.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

<a id="zipfile" name="zipfile">
  <h2>Getting started from ZIP files</h2>
</a>
<p>
  In case you need a very simple approach, you can just use this zip file. It contains a basic folder structure for a source plugin (but it can be used for extensions as well.) Please click the button below to download it.
</p>
<p>
  <button id="download"></button>
</p>
<p>
  In case you need to update the framework to the latest available version, you could always execute <code>bower update</code> on your CLI.
</p>
<hr />

<a id="cdn" name="cdn">
  <h2>Getting started using our CDN hosted file</h2>
</a>
<p>
  In case you need to create a plugin really quickly, all you have to do is add this line to your html file:
</p>
<pre class="language-markup"><code>&lt;script src="https://cdn2.xsplit.com/xjs/download/xjs.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Or use the minified version:</p>
<pre class="language-markup"><code>&lt;script src="https://cdn2.xsplit.com/xjs/download/xjs.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
  The problem with this method is that our servers cache static files, thus we cannot ensure that the file hosted is the latest version of the framework, especially if we just released a new version of the framework within the past 24 hours. <strong>We recommend exploring the other options instead of linking to our CDN if you are developing a plugin, and not merely testing out the capabilities of the framework.</strong>
