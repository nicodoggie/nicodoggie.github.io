<h1>Creating Advanced Plugins</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  After the introduction of Developing Sources and Extensions, and the information
  provided on our API. The next thing we should discuss is to the ability to create
  some more advanced plugins.
</p>
<p>
  An advanced plugin can be anything from utilizing our API, using DLL's' or even incorporating
  other services API. This could be anything that our API can support and your mind
  can conceive. With that in mind, what we can give you here are some ways and ideas
  that you may use in developing your own special plugin.
</p>

<h2>The API</h2>
<p>
  Our API is continuously being updated and improved to accommodate the new features and
  the growing needs of developers. If you still haven't checked our API, you should definitely
  do so to have a general idea of how framework works.
</p>
<p>
  The best way to utilize our API is by combining them to create a whole system that would
  trigger each other. One example for this is when you're starting your stream up and plays
  a video at the start. You can have set it up so that when the video is done playing, it
  would switch up to your next scene.
</p>
<p>
  This <b>Exntension Plugin</b> example will be devided into 3 parts:
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>let video;

xjs.Scene.getActiveScene()
.then(function(scene) {return scene})
.then(function(scene) {return scene.getItems()})
.then(function(items) {
  for (var item in items) {
    if (items[item] instanceof MediaItem) {
      video = items[item]
    }
  }
})</code>
</pre>
<p>
  First, is the way you could get the video item from the Scene. You would generally start
  on your Video/Intro scene and begin the stream from there. Here, you would get your video
  item and assign it to a variable, this will then be used on the second part.
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>xjs.ChannelManager.on('stream-start', function(start) {
  video.getPlaybackDuration().then(function(time) {
    //Set a timeout that would change the active scene
    //to desired scene after video plays.
    setTimeout(function() {
      xjs.Scene.setActiveScene(2)
    }, time * 1000)
  })

  //Ensure Video would begin from the start before playing
  video.setPlaybackPosition(0)
  video.setPlaying(true)
})</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Second, is to create an function that would listen for the <code>stream-start</code> event
  that would start a timer based on the video duration and switch the scene. At the same time,
  the video play duration will be triggered here. As an alternative option, you could set an additional
  delay as to when your video would start and should also be added on the scene change timer. This
  would be most helpful if you're still waiting for people to join your stream.
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
//You can do anything here! :)</code>
</pre>
<p>
  And last but not the least, is anything! You can do anything you want to add on this extension plugin.
  You can do anything from <i>Add Stream Controls, Scene Switching Controls, Display Stream Data or
  even some Source control</i>
</p>
