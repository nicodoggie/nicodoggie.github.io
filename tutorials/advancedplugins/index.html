<h1>Creating Advanced Plugins</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  After the introduction of Developing Sources and Extensions, and the information
  provided on our API. The next thing we should discuss is to the ability to create
  some more advanced plugins.
</p>
<p>
  An advanced plugin can be anything from utilizing our API, using DLL's' or even incorporating
  other services API. This could be anything that our API can support and your mind
  can conceive. With that in mind, what we can give you here are some ways and ideas
  that you may use in developing your own special plugin.
</p>

<h2>The API</h2>
<p>
  Our API is continuously being updated and improved to accommodate the new features and
  the growing needs of developers. If you still haven't checked our API, you should definitely
  do so to have a general idea of how framework works.
</p>
<p>
  The best way to utilize our API is by combining them to create a whole system that would
  trigger each other. One example for this is when you're starting your stream up and plays
  a video at the start. You can have set it up so that when the video is done playing, it
  would switch up to your next scene.
</p>
<p>
  This <b>Exntension Plugin</b> example will be devided into 3 parts:
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>let video;

xjs.Scene.getActiveScene()
.then(function(scene) {return scene})
.then(function(scene) {return scene.getItems()})
.then(function(items) {
  for (var item in items) {
    if (items[item] instanceof MediaItem) {
      video = items[item]
    }
  }
})</code>
</pre>
<p>
  First, is the way you could get the video item from the Scene. You would generally start
  on your Video/Intro scene and begin the stream from there. Here, you would get your video
  item and assign it to a variable, this will then be used on the second part.
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>xjs.ChannelManager.on('stream-start', function(start) {
  video.getPlaybackDuration().then(function(time) {
    //Set a timeout that would change the active scene
    //to desired scene after video plays.
    setTimeout(function() {
      xjs.Scene.setActiveScene(2)
    }, time * 1000)
  })

  //Ensure Video would begin from the start before playing
  video.setPlaybackPosition(0)
  video.setPlaying(true)
})</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Second, is to create an function that would listen for the <code>stream-start</code> event
  that would start a timer based on the video duration and switch the scene. At the same time,
  the video play duration will be triggered here. As an alternative option, you could set an additional
  delay as to when your video would start and should also be added on the scene change timer. This
  would be most helpful if you're still waiting for people to join your stream.
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
//You can do anything here! :)</code>
</pre>
<p>
  And last but not the least, is anything! You can do anything you want to add on this extension plugin.
  You can do anything from <i>Add Stream Controls, Scene Switching Controls, Display Stream Data or
  even some Source control</i>
</p>
<h2>DLL Utilization</h2>
<p>
  Other than just using the API to create your own advanced plugins. You can then also combine this with some
  DLLs and utilize it's function or even use it on its own for you to accomplish different functionalities on your plugin.
</p>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p>
  In creating a DLL for you plugin, you would need to first implement the XSplit plugin interface, implemment
  some functions in global namespace, and define <i>IXSplitScriptDllContext</i>
</p>
<p>The following functions must be implemented in global namespace:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
BOOLWINAPIXSplitScriptPluginInit();
BOOLWINAPIXSplitScriptPluginCall(IXSplitScriptDllContext*pContext,BSTR
functionName,BSTR*argumentsArray,UINTargumentsCount,BSTR*returnValue);
voidWINAPIXSplitScriptPluginDestroy();</code>
</pre>
<p>Define <i>IXSplitScriptDllContext</i> as follows:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
[uuid("9A554D8A-912F-4F1E-9A26-CC002B3B99BD")]
DECLARE_INTERFACE_(IXSplitScriptDllContext,IUnknown)
{
STDMETHOD(Callback)(BSTRfunctionName,BSTR*argumentsArray,UINT
argumentsCount)PURE;
};</code>
</pre>
<p>
  For the full document and guide on creating your DLL for XSplitBroadcaster please see <a href="assets/WritingcustomXSplitscriptDLLsinC.pdf">this document</a>
</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
  There are two ways you can use your DLLs, after loading them into your plugin through <a href="api.html#/core/Dll"><code>Dll.load()</code></a>.
  First is by calling the functions directly through <a href="api.html#/core/Dll"><code>Dll.call()</code></a> or <a href="api.html#/core/Dll"><code>Dll.callEx()</code></a> and the first
  parameter is the function name.
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
var dll = xjs.Dll;
dll.load(['Scriptdlls\\SplitMediaLabs\\dllA.dll','Scriptdlls\\SplitMediaLabs\\dllB.dll']);

dll.call('xsplit.EnumProcesses').then(function(value) {console.log(value);});
// sample return value: "0,4,456,608,724,856,864,940,972,620,1012"</code>
</pre>
<p>
  The full information and detailed guide regarding the creation and use of DLL can be checked
  at <a href="tutorials.html#/dll">Using DLLs for Extensibility</a> tutorials page. We also already have
  an existing XSplit DLL documentation which you can check on tutorials page listed above.
</p>

<h2>Other Services API</h2>
<p>
  Other than the use of our API and DLLs, you can also use other services API in developing
  your own plugin. These extenral services can be used to display relevant data on the stage,
  the most common example of this kind of services are chat and alerts, which streamers are
  very familiar with.
</p>
<p>
  Though we've already provided some plugins that does this for the more
  famous platforms, there may still be other sources that you might want to handle and create
  for your own.
</p>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>
  The very first thing you would need for this is that if the service you are trying to create
  a plugin from provides an API and a guide on how to use it.
