<h1>Creating Advanced Plugins</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  After the introduction of Developing Sources and Extensions, and the information
  provided on our API. The next thing we should discuss is to the ability to create
  some more advanced plugins.
</p>
<p>
  An advanced plugin can be anything from utilizing our API, using DLL's' or even incorporating
  other services API. This could be anything that our API can support and your mind
  can conceive. With that in mind, what we can give you here are some ways and ideas
  that you may use in developing your own special plugin.
</p>

<h2>The API</h2>
<p>
  Our API is continuously being updated and improved to accommodate the new features and
  the growing needs of developers. If you still haven't checked our API, you should definitely
  do so to have a general idea of how framework works.
</p>
<p>
  The best way to utilize our API is by combining them to create a whole system that would
  trigger each other. One example for this is when you're starting your stream up and plays
  a video at the start. You can have set it up so that when the video is done playing, it
  would switch up to your next scene.
</p>
<p>
  This example will be devided into 3 parts. First, is the way you could get the vide item
  from the Scene. Second, is the start of stream that would then play the video.
  Lastly, is the scene switch after the video plays.
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
var xjs = require('xjs');
xjs.ready().then(() => {
  let video;

  xjs.Scene.getActiveScene()
  .then(scene => {return scene})
  .then(scene => {return scene.getItems()})
  .then(items => {
    for (var item in items) {
      if (items[item] instanceof MediaItem) {
        video = items[item]
      }
    }
  })

  xjs.ChannelManager.on('stream-start', start => {
    video.setPlaying(true)
  })
});
</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Should include another chain of scene switch after the video plays...
