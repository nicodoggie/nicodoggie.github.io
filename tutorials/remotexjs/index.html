<h1>Remote XJS(BETA)</h1>

<h3>What is Remote XJS?</h3>
<p>
    Remote XJS, is like having a server and a client for XJS framework.
    Where a <strong>client</strong> would be able to make xjs calls that would be sent and processed in the <strong>server</strong> and then returned
    to the remote as if the call was just done locally.
</p>
<p>
    &#128187;Proxy &#x21e8; would work like a server, that handles all the calls that is sent from Remote.
    <br>Proxy would have the actual result of the calls and just relays it back to Remote.
</p>
<p>
    &#128187;Remote &#x21e8; would represent as the view and controller, and initiates the calls that would be sent to the Proxy.
    <br>

</p>
<p>
    From here on, the server will be referred to as <strong>proxy</strong> and the client as <strong>remote</strong>.
</p>

<h3>Prerequisite</h3>
<p>
    Just like how a server and client communicates, Remote xjs would also need to have a means of communicating with each other.
    This change in the framework however is only the handling of the calls from remote/proxy, the mode of transport/communication is not included in these changes and should be provided
    by the user.
</p>
<p>
    A communication channel should be first set up by the user between the remote and proxy. This could be anything from <i>websocket servers</i>, <i>data channels</i> or which ever
    you prefer. The method that is used to send and receive messages from these server/channel will be used and assigned to <code>xjs.Remote</code>.
</p>

<h3>Initializing on xjs.ready()</h3>
<p>
    Once the mode of communication have been set-up, assign the method to send a message to <code>sendMessage</code> on ready. While on the method that receives the message
    relay the message received to <code>xjs.Remote.receiveMessage(message)</code>. This set-up should be done on both your remote and proxy JS file.
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
var xjs = require('xjs');

xjs.ready({
 remote: {
   type: 'remote' // remote or proxy(default is local)
   sendMessage: function(message) {
     myConnection.send(message) // this will be assigned to Remote.sendMessage
   }
 }
})

// Relay received message(string)
xjs.Remote.receiveMessage(message)
</code></pre>
<p>
    Once these are set up, there wouldn't be anything else to be changed. Use xjs like usual and the framework would do the rest.
</p>

<h3>Sample Set-up using Websocket server</h3>
<p>
    Here is a simple example as to how to set-up your connection with the remote and proxy using a local
    Websocket server.
</p>

<h4>Remote</h4>
<p>
    In this example, after ready(where we've set-up it's type and sendMessage), set to listen for the stream start and stream end events are set.
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
var connection = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:1337');

var xjs = require('xjs');


connection.onopen = function () {
  // Set an identity
  connection.send('Remote')

  xjs.ready({
  remote: {
    type: 'remote'
    sendMessage: function(message) {
      myConnection.send(message) // this will be assigned to Remote.sendMessage
    }
  }
  }).then(function () {
      xjs.ChannelManager.on('stream-start', function(res) {
        // Do something when the stream starts.
      })
      xjs.ChannelManager.on('stream-end', function(res) {
        // Do something when the stream ends.
      })
    })
}

connection.onmessage = function (message) {
    // Because we know that the server always returns JSON
    try {
      var json = JSON.parse(message.data);
    } catch (e) {
      console.log('This doesn\'t look like a valid JSON: ', message.data);
      return;
    }

    if (json.data.author === 'Proxy') {
      //Relay the message to receiveMessage
      xjs.Remote.receiveMessage(json.data.text)
    }

};
</code></pre>
<h4>Proxy</h4>
<p>
    This would only have a basic set-up, since proxy would only receive and process the message to be
    sent to the proper method and return the result to remote.
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
var connection = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:1337');

var xjs = require('xjs');


connection.onopen = function () {
  // Set an identity
  connection.send('Proxy')

  xjs.ready({
  remote: {
    type: 'proxy'
    sendMessage: function(message) {
      myConnection.send(message) // this will be assigned to Remote.sendMessage
    }
  }
  })
}

connection.onmessage = function (message) {
    try {
      var json = JSON.parse(message.data);
    } catch (e) {
      console.log('This doesn\'t look like a valid JSON: ', message.data);
      return;
    }

    if (json.data.author === 'Remote') {
      //Relay the message to receiveMessage
      xjs.Remote.receiveMessage(json.data.text)
    }

};
</code></pre>
<p>
    The set-up made above with websocket does not include the <code>server.js</code> that handles the websocket events.
    This is just a simple representation of how it can be used inside the JS file of a plugin. For a simple example of a webscoket chat server that
    works similarly to the given example above, you can check out

<div class="information">
  <h3><span id='information'>&#128712; </span>Additional Information/Limitation</h3>
  <p>
    This feature is still on its <strong>BETA</strong> phase and there might still be instances/methods that may not be handled properly or are not handled completely yet.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, SourcePropsWindow and Dialog Window events are not included in handling remotely.
  </p>
  <p>
    We might have a proxy..  bla bla.. in the future
