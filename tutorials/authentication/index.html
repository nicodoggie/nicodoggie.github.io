<h1>Authenticating to External Services</h1>
<p><em>Note: this section may be subject to change.</em></p>

<p>Many plugins will require authentication to services before they can provide their main functionality. Many source plugins use these services to fetch relevant data to be displayed on the stage. Standard authentication processes such as OAuth will be tricky to implement because there are limits to the source properties window (such as auto-hiding of the window when focus is lost), so we are providing this recommended pattern for authentication. <em>This tutorial is primarily for source plugins, but is also applicable to extensions.</em></p>

<p>We suggest persisting both XBC user data and authentication data together, so that other XBC users logging in to the same machine will not be forced to use the same external service data. One possible way to do this will be to persist authentication data in the form <code>userHash:data</code>, where <code>userHash</code> is taken from <a href="api.html#/core/App#getUserIdHash" target="_blank"><code>getUserIdHash()</code></a>, and <code>data</code> represents authentication data from other services, such as a token, or other important string.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Your plugin's source properties window should have some kind of authentication/authorization button. The plugin should also have some means for users to deauthorize.)
  <ul>
    <li>You can check if some authentication token for the current XBC user already exists on the machine. (Make sure to compare against the <code>userHash</code> as described above.) If an entry exists in memory<sup>1</sup>, then you can skip the rest of the steps and simply obtain the saved authentication data corresponding to the current XBC user.</li>
    <li>This means that when the user clicks a button to deauthenticate, your plugin should remove the entry from local storage. It is also important to clear all cookies using <code>App.clearBrowserCookies()</code><sup>1</sup> for the next authentication action, as this may affect other plugins trying to connect to other services.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Clicking this button should open a new dialog (see <a href="api.html#/window/Dialog#createDialog" target="_blank"><code>createDialog()</code></a>) to a URL you control. This URL can contain a page that contacts the external service's authentication protocol, optionally requests for any additional authorization from the service, and finally, retrieves any pertinent information.<ul><li>Pertinent information is usually some authentication token, as required by the plugin.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>When the process completes (and returns information), the dialog should call <a href="api.html#/window/Dialog#return" target="_blank"><code>Dialog.return()</code></a><sup>2</sup> with the data relevant to your plugin. This closes the dialog.</li>
  <li>This result is captured by the <a href="api.html#/window/Dialog#getResult" target="_blank"><code>getResult()</code></a> method of the original Dialog object within the context of the properties window. Note that this function can only accept strings.</li>
  <li>Save the result into local storage<sup>1</sup>. We highly recommend linking the result to the current user (through the <code>userHash</code>).
  <li>To accommodate any other plugins that may connect to the same services, you should also clear all cookies using <code>App.clearBrowserCookies()</code>. </li>
</ol>

<p>You should now have the necessary data for your plugin to work. Your plugin should now also play well with other plugins. Congratulations!</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Your service should ideally not depend on cookies for storing authentication, because it is possible for any plugin to erase all cookies in the application. We suggest the use of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage/LocalStorage" target="_new">localStorage API</a>.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> <code>Dialog.return()</code> is made available for pages that also include <code>xjs.js</code>, as all dialogs can still perform framework-related functions. However, for lightweight dialogs that simply need to return a value, you may simply execute the following calls to save on file size: <br /><br /><code>external.SetDialogResult('string');</code><br /><code>external.Close();</code></p>
