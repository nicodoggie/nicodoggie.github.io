<h1>Developing Sources</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  Sources are objects that may be added to your presentation to be included in
  your streams and recordings. While XSplit does provide native source plugins
  such as cameras, games, and even RTMP streams, it is also possible to create
  your own source plugin using HTML.
</p>
<p>
  To test your HTML plugin, simply drag the HTML file onto the stage.
  Alternatively, if you are locally or remotely hosting the source, you may add
  the hosted page by clicking Sources > Other > Webpage URL within
  XSplit Broadcaster.
</p>

<h3>Initializing Source Plugins</h3>
<p>
  Let's get right to some sample code! This initializes the source plugin's name.
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>// get necessary classes
var xjs = require('xjs');
var Source = xjs.Source;

// always wait for the framework to finish initialization
xjs.ready()
  .then(Source.getCurrentSource)
  .then(function(mySource) {
    return mySource.setName('My First Source Plugin');
  });</code></pre>
<p>
  Occasionally, you might want to create a source plugin that is meant to be
  overlaid on the entire viewport. This means you will want to configure the
  actual renderer (video items) of the source. In order to do this, you will
  have to acquire references to the video item list, as seen in the code sample
  below. (For more information on video items, please see the tutorial about
  <a href="tutorials.html#/linkedsources">linked
  sources</a>.)
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>
mySource.getItemList()
  .then(function(items) {
    // when your source is first created, there should be exactly one renderer
    return items[0];
  }).then(function(initialItem) {
    // initialize the item to occupy the entire scene
    initialItem.setPosition(xjs.Rectangle.fromCoordinates(0, 0, 1, 1));
  });</code></pre>
<p>
  To do more advanced initialization (such as loading of a more complex
  configuration for your source), you will need to define your own
  configuration objects.
</p>

<h3>Configuration Objects</h3>
<p>
  A custom configuration object may also be applied to sources. Configuration
  objects are simple JSON objects that sources can save to memory.
</p>
<p>
  There are no standards prescribed for the configuration object; developers may
  use any valid JSON object. It is the responsibility of the source to load the
  saved object every time the source is loaded, and to apply the object's
  various settings onto the source. This should be done when the framework is
  <code>ready()</code>.
</p>
<p>
  The source plugins you create are <code>HTMLSource</code> instances. They
  implement the <a href="api.html#/core/ISourceConfigurable">
  <code>ISourceConfigurable</code></a> interface, and can thus persist
  a configuration object. You can use the <code>saveConfig</code> method to save
  your configuration. As a standard practice, we suggest that you do not allow
  configuration within the source HTML itself; instead, allow users to configure
  the source through the source properties dialog. More information can be found
  <a href="tutorials.html#/sourceconfig">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Once your plugin has defined and saved a configuration object, it is your task
  as a plugin developer to load and apply these configurations. Take a look:
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>var xjs = require('xjs');
var Source = xjs.Source;

// within the source HTML, we initialize the settings
xjs.ready()
  .then(Source.getCurrentSource)
  .then(function(mySource) {
    return mySource.loadConfig();
  }).then(function(config) {
    // Do some checking to see if we already have settings saved.
    // The config should be empty if this is the first time the source is added.
    if (Object.keys(config) > 0) {
      // Load previous settings, based on the structure of your configuration object.
      // Note that if you already have saved settings, you probably shouldn't force
      // any default settings.

      // do something with config here...
    } else {
      // Set initial settings here.
      return mySource.setName('My newly added source!')
    }).then(function(mySource) {
      // Property setters are chainable, so they resolve with the same object!
      // This means you can continue setting any properties.
      return mySource.setKeepLoaded(true); // always keep loaded in memory
    }).then(function(mySource) {
      // Continue initialization as necessary. We recommend saving a dummy
      // value in the configuration object to indicate that the defaults have
      // already been applied. If the user refreshes the source, you will
      // know not to override your user's position/size settings!
      mySource.saveConfig({
        defaultsLoaded: true
      });
    });
  }
});</code></pre>

<h3>Source Plugin Window utility</h3>
<p>
  There is a utility class for source plugins which is used in conjunction with
  the source properties window. The <code>SourcePluginWindow</code> class is an
  Event Emitter. This class is used to detect any important events that sources
  are currently able to receive from the application. For example, a source that
  is kept loaded in memory may detect a scene change through the
  <code>scene-load</code> event emitted by <code>SourcePluginWindow</code>.
</p>
<p>One of its more important functions for fully-featured plugins is to save
  configuration objects when instructed by the source properties window. See this
  <a href="tutorials.html#/sourceconfig#man-config-obj" target="_blank">tutorial</a>
  for more details.
