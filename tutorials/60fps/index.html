<h1>60 FPS Browser Sources</h1>

<p>By default, HTML sources run at a maximum of 30 frames per second. For more advanced uses, your HTML may request to use up to 60 FPS instead. To do this, simply execute the following code:</p>

<code>window.external.SetLocalProperty("prop:Browser60fps","1");</code>

<p>Please be informed that this is currently an experimental feature, and may not work perfectly for different machines.</p>
