<h1>60 FPS Browser Sources</h1>
<p>
  By default, HTML sources run at a maximum of 30 frames per second.
  For more advanced uses, your HTML page may request to use up to 60 FPS instead.
</p>
<p>
  This can be achieved by adding <code>window.external.SetLocalProperty("prop:Browser60fps","1");</code> on your source.
</p>
<h3>You can do any of the following to enable 60fps on your HTML Sources:</h3>
<h4>Modify original HTML/JS</h4>
<p>
  Add the custom script above anywhere on your <code>script</code> tag on your HTML or add it inside your JS file.
</p>
<h4>Inject custom JS</h4>
<p>
  You can inject the code above through the Custom Code option on an HTML Source source property window.
</p>

<p>
  After adding the custom script, this would automatically take effect and your source would refresh itself if needed.
</p>
<h4>Manually change Presentation file</h4>
<p>
  You can also save the presentation where you have your HTML Source, and manually change the 60fps file property of your source.
</p>
<p>
  First, save the presentation that contains your HTML Source, that would create a file with a <code>BPres</code> extension.
  Open this file on any text editor and search for <code>Browser60fps</code> property and set it to 1, save, then load the presentation again.
