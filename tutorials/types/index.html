<h1>Types of Plugins</h1>
<p>
  The framework allows developers to create two types of plugins for XSplit Broadcaster: source plugins and extension plugins. Sources are added to the stage to be recorded or streamed live, while extensions occupy their own window and are given elevated privileges to manipulate sources and certain application properties.
</p>
<h3>Sources</h3>
<p>
   A source is a plugin placed on the stage. Right-clicking the source opens its properties window. Using HTML/CSS/JavaScript, developers can create any kind of source, and a properties window for that source. For more information on developing sources, <a href="tutorials.html#/sourceplugins">click here</a>.
</p>
<h3>Extensions</h3>
<p>
   Extensions are plugins on the global level. They are still developed using HTML, and have all the capabilities of sources and more. Please check out the API for the current set of implemented features, and drop us a line here to discuss any feature requests. A list of additional notes regarding extensions can be found <a href="tutorials.html#/extensions">here</a>.
