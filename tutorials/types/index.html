<h1>Types of Plugins</h1>
<p>
  The XSplit JS Framework allows developers to create two types of plugins for XSplit Broadcaster: source plugins and extension plugins. Sources are added to the stage to be recorded or streamed live, while extensions occupy their own window and are given elevated privileges to manipulate sources and certain application properties. A third type of plugin in our plugin store, outputs, are not possible to create using the JS Framework.
</p>
<h3>Sources</h3>
<p>
   A source is a plugin meant to be captured through your stream or recording. With the exception of the native audio device source (<code>AudioSource</code> class), all sources occupy some position in the stage. Right-clicking the source opens its properties window, allowing users to customize the source and configure it. Using HTML/CSS/JavaScript, developers can create an HTML source, and specify the properties for that source.

<h3>Extensions</h3>
<p>
   Extensions are plugins on the application level that empower you to create more dynamic presentations by manipulating sources, changing the application's settings, switching scenes, and more. They are also developed using HTML. Please check out the API for the current set of implemented features, and drop us a line <a href="http://xjsframework.github.io/support.html">at xjs support</a> to discuss any feature requests. A list of additional notes regarding extensions can be found <a href="tutorials.html#/extensions">here</a>.
</p>
<h3>Outputs</h3>
<p>
   Outputs are plugins built into the application that configuring streaming and recording settings for streaming services and the like. They are also in charge of authenticating to these services, and managing any channels or live videos that are set up on the services. Currently, the XSplit JS Framework cannot be used to create any Output Plugins. If you manage a streaming service and would like to discuss integration with XSplit, please contact us through XSplit's primary <a href="https://supportdesk.xsplit.com/">support channel</a>.
