<h1>Linked Sources</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>XSplit now offers users the ability to show the same source across different scenes, or even the same scene. These linked sources are actually a single source with multiple renderers (video items). Even when changing scenes, the state of the source is retained. This is incredibly useful for things such as timers or for browser sources with animations.</p>

<h3>Sources and Items</h3>
<p>When adding sources to the stage, there are actually two entities at play. The source (<code>Source</code> class) is the actual camera device, browser page, game capture, or whatever object is to be captured. The video item (<code>Item</code> class) is the renderer of that source.</p>

<p>The <code>Source</code> contains source-level properties such as the target window of a <code>ScreenSource</code>, audio input settings for a <code>CameraSource</code>, and whether to show the mouse cursor in a <code>GameSource</code>. The corresponding renderers (<code>ScreenItem</code>, <code>CameraItem</code>, <code>GameItem</code>, etc.) handle the renderer-level properties: Should this rendering item be visible in its scene? Should the item be cropped?</p>

<p>Generally speaking, you can code your sources using mostly source properties, especially if you define your own configuration object (read about <a href="xjsframework.github.io/tutorials.html#/sourceplugins">Configuration Objects</a> for more details.) From experience, a source only needs to bother with item properties in use cases such as letting the source be displayed on the entire viewport on initialization.</p>

<p>You can check the available source properties through their respective class documentation in the API docs (check the different <code>Source</code> classes). As for item-level properties, you can check the <code>Item</code> classes, or just refer to the following table for a complete list.</p>

<p>* <em>Note about names: as of XSplit 2.9, the name and cname property are now source properties. Modifying the source's name essentially modifies the name of all items rendering that source.</em></p>

<h3>Linked Sources</h3>

<p>A source can actually be linked to more than one item. This allows a single source to be displayed on different sources with different positions and sizes in the stage, while showing the exact same state of the source even across scenes.</p>

<p>In order to create a linked source, simply copy (Ctrl+C) on a source, then paste (Ctrl+V). This creates a second item that is linked to the same source as the original. If you want to copy as a separate source (i.e., unlinked copy), you can use Ctrl+Shift+V instead.</p>

<p>The XSplit JS Framework allows you to programmatically paste items, through <a href="xjsframework.github.io/api.html#/core/Item#duplicate"><code>Item.duplicate()</code></a>. You can get a specific video item, and executing duplicate should paste a second item in the exact same position as the first. You also have the option to paste linked, and even to paste to another scene entirely.</p>

<p>The following illustration shows the process of pasting a new source. You can see that the unlinked text (above) is in a different scrolling state from the linked texts (below). The linked ones show the exact same text despite being in different positions.</p>

<h3>Additional technical information</h3>

<p><strong>Unlinking.</strong> When you unlink an item, it now renders a source that is totally separate from the original. There is no way to re-link back to the original source.</p>

<p><strong>XSplit 2.8.</strong> The original implementation of global/linked sources in XSplit conflated the ideas of a "Global Source" with a "Source kept in memory." <code>xjs@1.4.0+</code> reflected this application behavior; thus, calling <code>setKeepLoaded(true)</code> automatically converted a source to be "global". XSplit 2.9 did away with this idea. Now, sources can be linked to several items without being kept in memory themselves. <code>xjs@2.0.0+</code> also reflects this breaking behavior, and now more faithfully represents the difference between sources and their corresponding items.</p>
