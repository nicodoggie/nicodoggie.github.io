<h1>Debugging Your Plugins</h1>
<div class="notice"><strong>Important Notice:</strong> Google Chrome removed support for remote debugging starting from Chrome 50. For developers who updated to the said version or higher, you may use the following alternatives:
	<ul>
		<li>load the remote debugging discovery page as an extension in XBC; or</li>
		<li>download an independent CEF build from <a href="https://cefbuilds.com/" target="_blank">https://cefbuilds.com/</a> and use them to load the remote debugging discovery page. (Click on a "Test App" link for any item that's Chromium 49 at most.)</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<p>XSplit Broadcaster allows you to debug your pages by exposing the DevTools. To do this, create a shortcut to <code>XSplit.Core.exe</code>, and right-click to open the properties window to add the startup parameter: <code>remotedebug:<em>&lt;port&gt;</em></code>. The default is port 9222, but you can use your preferred port (just ensure that no other process is also using it.)
</p>

<p>Once this is done, simply open <code>http://localhost:<em>&lt;port&gt;</em></code> (the remote debugging discovery page) on your browser. You will see a list of links, each pertaining to a plugin/webpage URL and labeled through their <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element, or if not present, their URL. Click the link pertaining to your plugin to begin debugging. Note that this is not just for sources, but for extensions as well!</p>

<h2>Debugging Your Source Properties Window</h2>
<p>Debugging the source properties window is a bit tricky. To do this, you would need to download the <code>xsplitprops.html</code> file <a href = "http://cdn2.xsplit.com/xjs/download/xsplitprops.html" target="_blank" download>here</a> and move it to the same folder where <code>XSplit.Core.exe</code> is located. This is a special build for debugging.</p>

<p>After this, you would need to add the startup parameter to XSplit: <code>enablehtmlprop:2</code>.</p>

<p>You will now then be able to see the <code>XBC Source Properties_debugger</code> item on the remote debugging page, together with your plugins. Click on this link and you can start debugging the source property window you wrote.</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong><i>The XBC Source Properties_debugger will allow you to debug the source properties of the source that was last right-clicked. With that said, make sure that you open your plugin's source properties first before debugging XBC Source Properties_debugger.</i></p>
