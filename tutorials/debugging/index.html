<h1>Debugging Your Plugins</h1>
<p>XSplit Broadcaster allows you to debug your pages by exposing the DevTools. To do this, create a shortcut to <code>XSplit.Core.exe</code>, and right-click to open the properties window to add the startup parameter: <code>remotedebug:<em>&lt;port&gt;</em></code>. We usually use port 9222 (unless another process is also using it.)

<p>Once this is done, simply open <code>localhost:<em>&lt;port&gt;</em></code> on your browser. You will see a list of links, each pertaining to a plugin/webpage URL source and labeled through their TITLE element, or if not present, their URL. Click the link pertaining to your plugin to begin debugging.</p>

<p><strong>Important note</strong>: Debugging for the source properties window is not available at this time.</p>
