          Plugins are important tools for extending the functionality of XSplit Broadcaster. In order to allow developers to create useful plugins for the community, we created the XSplit JS Framework to encapsulate the capabilities of the application in an easy-to-understand manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will walk you through on how to get started building your own XSplit Broadcaster plugin using this framework.
        </p>
        <h1>Installing XSplit JS Framework</h1>
        <p>
          You will need the latest developer build of XSplit Broadcaster to use the XSplit JS Framework. The framework requires minimum XBC version 2.7.1512.2124, unless stated otherwise in the API documentation.
        </p>
        <div class="download-xbc">
            <a href="http://cdn2.xsplit.com/download/bc/m32/XSplit_Broadcaster_2.9.1701.1616.exe" title="Latest Developer Build">
            <span class="softwareIcon"></span>
            <span class="softwareInfo">
              <span class="softwareDownloadText">Download XSplit Broadcaster</span>
              <span class="softwareVersion">Version 2.9.1701.1616</span>
              <span class="softwareRelease">| Latest Official Build</span>
            </span>
            </a>
        </div>
        <p>
          You can install or start using the framework in a lot of ways, but fastest and the most basic way is to download <a href='http://cdn2.xsplit.com/xjs/download/2.1.1/xjs.js'><code>XSplit JS Framework</code></a>, add it on your project folder, import it on your html file, and you are good to go.
        </p>
        <a id="start" name="start">
          <h2>Getting Started with xjs.js</h2>
        </a>
          <p>
            With XSplit JS framework together with XSplit Broadcaster, you can do a lot of things to improve your streams/recordings or even make your tasks easier with the use of plugins.
          </p>
          <p>
            So what do you need to do to get started? Simply download the XSplit JS Framework and you can use it immediately.
            Outlined below is a simple demonstration on how you can use the framework in creating your own plugin.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that you will need working knowledge of JavaScript and ES6 Promises to use the framework.
          </p>
        <a id="source" name="source">
          <h2>Creating your first Source Plugin</h2>
        </a>
        <p>
          For this example, we'll create a source plugin that would change text automatically when you start your stream.
          This example would use the <code>ChannelManager</code> class of the framework, that can be used to listen for the <code>stream-start</code> and <code>stream-end</code> of XSplit Broadcaster.
        </p>
<pre class="language-markup">
<code>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div id="stream-status"&gt;
  Stream is not Live
  &lt;/div"&gt;
  &lt;script src="js/xjs.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script src="js/main.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>
  You can see above, we have set up an initial html file that imports the framework.
  We have also created a div that contains the intial text when the stream is not yet live/recording, and would change immediately when the stream would start.
</p>
<p>
  Next, we would now use the framework on our <code>main.js</code> file.
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
var xjs = require('xjs');

xjs.ready().then(function(){
  xjs.ChannelManager.on('stream-start', function(){
    document.getElementById('stream-status').innerHTML = 'Stream is Live';
  })

  xjs.ChannelManager.on('stream-end', function(){
    document.getElementById('stream-status').innerHTML = 'Stream is not Live';
  })
})</code>
</pre>
<p>
  <em>* We're assuming that you are knowledgeable with Promises in JavaScript. If you are not, please do check it out on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise" target="_blank">MDN</a> or other articles about Promise programming.</em>
</p>
<p>
  First, the framework is loaded and saved into the <code>xjs</code> variable. We would thenn access the frameworks <code>ready()</code> method; a method that returns a promise,
  which resolves when XSplit JS Framework is ready to use. Always make sure to do your development when the framework is ready!
</p>
<p>
  Let's disect the code further...
</p>
XSplit Broadcaster emits an event <code>stream-start/end</code>, and the <code>ChannelManager</code> class has access to listen to these events.
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
xjs.ChannelManager.on('stream-start')

xjs.ChannelManager.on('stream-end')</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Here, we include a handler that would make the action when the your stream has started/stopped. Since, this class would only listen
  to when the event would be emitted, we would have to set it here as to what should be done when it happens.
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
function(){
    document.getElementById('stream-status').innerHTML = 'Stream is not Live/Live';
  }</code>
</pre>
<p>
  And then, you can create a CSS file and update how your plugin would look like.
  For this example, I set the background-color as transparent for it to blend in with the scene and only the text would be visible.
</p>
<pre class="language-css">
<code>
body {
  background-color: transparent;
  color: white;
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Once, you are done with all of this, you would have to add and test your plugin. You can simply drag the index.html file to the stage or add it as a media file:
</p>
<p class="center inner-padding-10">
  <img class="quick-img" src="assets/add-media.png">
  <img class="quick-img" src="assets/add-media-2.png">
</p>
<p>
  Of course, we need to check it out right?
</p>
<p class="center inner-padding-10">
  <img class="quick-img" src="assets/sample-source.gif">
</p>
<p>
  And there you have it, your very first Source plugin!
</p>
<p>

  please check the <a href="tutorials.html#/sourceplugins">Developing Sources</a> tutorials page.
</p>
<hr />

        <a id="extension" name="extension">
          <h2>Creating your first Extension Plugin</h2>
        </a>
        <p>
          The same way that Source Plugins are created, we also start with setting up an initial HTML file.
          For this one, we'll be creating an extension plugin that would load up all the scenes into buttons
          and also display your current scene.
        </p>
<pre class="language-markup">
<code>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sample Scene Switch&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div id='scene-id'&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;script src="js/xjs.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="js/main.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>
  In the above hmtl, the div with id <code>scene-id</code> is where all the detected scenes will be appended.
  We then have the <code>main.js</code> file that would contain the use of the framework.
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>var xjs = require('xjs');

xjs.ready()
.then(function(){
  return xjs.Scene.getSceneCount()
}).then(function(count){
  for(var i = 1; i < count + 1; i++){
    xjs.Scene.getById(i).then(function(scene){
      var newElement = document.createElement('BUTTON');
      var t = document.createTextNode('Scene:: '+ (scene._id + 1))
      newElement.appendChild(t)
      document.getElementById('scene-id').appendChild(newElement)
      newElement.addEventListener('click', function(){
        xjs.Scene.setActiveScene(scene._id + 1)
      })
    })
  }
})</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Now, let's dissect the sample code above.
</p>
<p>
  XSplit Broadcaster can have any number of scenes and we can get the current number using <code>getSceneCount</code>.
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
.then(function(){
  return xjs.Scene.getSceneCount()
})</code>
</pre>
<p>
  After we get the scene count from the code above, we use this number to get the id of each scene
  for us to be abple to map into an element.
</p>
<p>
  The code below then gets the scene object using the scene counts as an id.
  with this, we can map each scene and add it on to our extension and assign a button for each scene.
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
xjs.Scene.getById(i).then(function(scene){
  var newElement = document.createElement('BUTTON');
  var t = document.createTextNode('Scene:: '+ (scene._id + 1))
  newElement.appendChild(t)
  document.getElementById('scene-id').appendChild(newElement)
  newElement.addEventListener('click', function(){
    xjs.Scene.setActiveScene(scene._id + 1)
  })
})</code></pre>
<p>
  After assigning each instance of Scene with a button, we also add a click event listener on them and call <code>setActiveScene</code>
  on them to change the scene to clicked scene number on the extension.
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
newElement.addEventListener('click', function(){
  xjs.Scene.setActiveScene(scene._id + 1)
})</code></pre>
<p>
  Once this is all done, you could add your extension. This though, would be different to adding a Source plugin.
  Here, you would need to add it on the Extensions option and then browse the file.
</p>
<p class="center inner-padding-10">
  <img class="quick-img" src="assets/add_ext_1.png">
  <img class="quick-img" src="assets/add_ext_2.png">
</p>
<p>
  After selecting the file, you will then see it on the Extensions option, clicking this would open your Extension on a separate window.
</p>
<p class="center inner-padding-10">
  <img class="quick-img" src="assets/extension_sample.gif">
</p>
<p>
  And there you have it! An extension plugin that contains all your scenes and can also switch scenes.
</p>

        <p>
          Here are a couple of sample plugins that showcases what you can actually do using XSplit JS Framework. You could check out the source code to get a better understanding on how the plugin works.
        </p>
        <h3><em>Scene Rotator Extension plugin</em></h3>
        <p>
          This plugin demonstrates what you can do on Extension plugins. The Scene Rotator plugin would automatically switch to the specified scenes after the given interval. Please do check out the source code at <a href="https://github.com/xjsframework/scene-rotator" target="_blank">github</a>.
        </p>
        <h3><em>Source Toggler Source plugin</em></h3>
        <p>
          This plugin demonstrates what you can do on Source plugins, specifically on how source plugins modify other item sources' properties. The Source Toggler plugin would allow the user to attach two other sources and then modify its position and rotation properties. Please do check out the source code at <a href="https://github.com/xjsframework/source-toggler" target="_blank">github</a>.
        </p>
        <h3><em>Twitch Chat Viewer via Twitch Chat Popout</em></h3>
        <p>
          This plugin demonstrates a different take on doing plugins. This involves injecting custom javascript and css to style and add configurability to an already existing webpage.
