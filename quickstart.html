          Plugins are important tools for extending the functionality of XSplit Broadcaster. In order to allow developers to create useful plugins for the community, we created the XSplit JS Framework to encapsulate the capabilities of the application in an easy-to-understand manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will walk you through on how to get started building your own XSplit Broadcaster plugin using this framework.
        </p>
        <h1>Installing XSplit JS Framework</h1>
        <p>
          You will need the latest developer build of XSplit Broadcaster to use the XSplit JS Framework. The framework requires minimum XBC version 2.7.1512.2124, unless stated otherwise in the API documentation.
        </p>
        <div class="download-xbc">
            <a href="http://cdn2.xsplit.com/download/bc/m32/XSplit_Broadcaster_2.9.1701.1616.exe" title="Latest Developer Build">
            <span class="softwareIcon"></span>
            <span class="softwareInfo">
              <span class="softwareDownloadText">Download XSplit Broadcaster</span>
              <span class="softwareVersion">Version 2.9.1701.1616</span>
              <span class="softwareRelease">| Latest Official Build</span>
            </span>
            </a>
        </div>
        <p>
          You can install or start using the framework in a lot of ways, but fastest and the most basic way is to download <a href='http://cdn2.xsplit.com/xjs/download/2.1.1/xjs.js'><code>xjs.js</code></a>, add it on your project folder, import it on your html file, and you are good to go in using it.
          Outlined below is a simple demonstration on how you can use the framework in creating your own plugin.

          <h2>Sample Plugins</h2>
        </a>
        <p>
          Here are a couple of sample plugins that showcases what you can actually do using XSplit JS Framework. You could check out the source code to get a better understanding on how the plugin works.
        </p>
        <h3><em>Scene Rotator Extension plugin</em></h3>
        <p>
          This plugin demonstrates what you can do on Extension plugins. The Scene Rotator plugin would automatically switch to the specified scenes after the given interval. Please do check out the source code at <a href="https://github.com/xjsframework/scene-rotator" target="_blank">github</a>.
        </p>
        <h3><em>Source Toggler Source plugin</em></h3>
        <p>
          This plugin demonstrates what you can do on Source plugins, specifically on how source plugins modify other item sources' properties. The Source Toggler plugin would allow the user to attach two other sources and then modify its position and rotation properties. Please do check out the source code at <a href="https://github.com/xjsframework/source-toggler" target="_blank">github</a>.
        </p>
        <h3><em>Twitch Chat Viewer via Twitch Chat Popout</em></h3>
        <p>
          This plugin demonstrates a different take on doing plugins. This involves injecting custom javascript and css to style and add configurability to an already existing webpage. Please do check out the source code at <a href="https://github.com/xjsframework/twitch-chat-viewer-popout" target="_blank">github</a>.
