          Plugins are important tools for extending the functionality of XSplit Broadcaster. In order to allow developers to create useful plugins for the community, we created the XSplit JS Framework to encapsulate the capabilities of the application in an easy-to-understand manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will walk you through on how to get started building your own XSplit Broadcaster plugin using this framework.
        </p>
        <h1>Installing XSplit JS Framework</h1>
        <p>
          You will need the latest developer build of XSplit Broadcaster to use the XSplit JS Framework. The framework requires minimum XBC version 2.7.1512.2124, unless stated otherwise in the API documentation.
        </p>
        <div class="download-xbc">
            <a href="http://cdn2.xsplit.com/download/bc/m32/XSplit_Broadcaster_2.9.1701.1616.exe" title="Latest Developer Build">
            <span class="softwareIcon"></span>
            <span class="softwareInfo">
              <span class="softwareDownloadText">Download XSplit Broadcaster</span>
              <span class="softwareVersion">Version 2.9.1701.1616</span>
              <span class="softwareRelease">| Latest Official Build</span>
            </span>
            </a>
        </div>
        <p>
          You can install or start using the framework in a lot of ways, but fastest and the most basic way is to download <a href='http://cdn2.xsplit.com/xjs/download/2.1.1/xjs.js'><code>XSplit JS Framework</code></a>, add it on your project folder, import it on your html file, and you are good to go.
        </p>
        <a id="start" name="start">
          <h2>Getting Started with xjs.js</h2>
        </a>
          <p>
            With XSplit JS framework together with XSplit Broadcaster, you can do a lot of things to improve your streams/recordings or even make your tasks easier with the use of plugins.
          </p>
          <p>
            So what do you need to do to get started? Simply download the XSplit JS Framework and you can use it immediately.
            Outlined below is a simple demonstration on how you can use the framework in creating your own plugin.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that you will need working knowledge of JavaScript and ES6 Promises to use the framework.
          </p>
        <a id="source" name="source">
          <h2>Creating your first Source Plugin</h2>
        </a>
        <p>
          For this example, we'll create a source plugin that would change text automatically when you start your stream.
          This example would use the <code>ChannelManager</code> class of the framework, that can be used to listen for the <code>stream-start</code> and <code>stream-end</code> of XSplit Broadcaster.
        </p>
<pre class="language-markup">
<code>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div id="stream-status"&gt;
  Stream is not Live
  &lt;/div"&gt;
  &lt;script src="js/xjs.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script src="js/main.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code>
</pre>
<p>
  You can see above, we have set up an initial html file that imports the framework.
  We have also created a div that contains the intial text when the stream is not yet live/recording, and would change immediately when the stream would start.
</p>
<p>
  Next, we would now use the framework on our <code>main.js</code> file.
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
var xjs = require('xjs');

xjs.ready().then(function(){
  xjs.ChannelManager.on('stream-start', function(){
    document.getElementById('stream-status').innerHTML = 'Stream is Live';
  })

  xjs.ChannelManager.on('stream-end', function(){
    document.getElementById('stream-status').innerHTML = 'Stream is not Live';
  })
})</code>
</pre>
<p>
  First, the framework is loaded and saved into the <code>xjs</code> variable. We would thenn access the frameworks <code>ready()</code> method; a method that returns a promise,
  which resolves when XSplit JS Framework is ready to use. Always make sure to do your development when the framework is ready!
</p>
<p>
  Let's disect the code further...
</p>
XSplit Broadcaster emits an event <code>stream-start/end</code>, and the <code>ChannelManager</code> class has access to listen to these events.
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
xjs.ChannelManager.on('stream-start')

xjs.ChannelManager.on('stream-end')</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Here, we include a handler that would make the action when the your stream has started/stopped. Since, this class would only listen
  to when the event would be emitted, we would have to set it here as to what should be done when it happens.
</p>
<pre class="language-javascript">
<code>
function(){
    document.getElementById('stream-status').innerHTML = 'Stream is not Live/Live';
  }</code>
</pre>
<p>
  And then, you can create a CSS file and update how your plugin would look like.
  For this example, I set the background-color as transparent for it to blend in with the scene and only the text would be visible.
</p>
<pre class="language-css">
<code>
body {
  background-color: transparent;
  color: white;
}</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Once, you are done with all of this, you would have to add and test your plugin. You can simply drag the index.html file to the stage or add it as a media file:
</p>
<p class="center inner-padding-10">
  <img src="assets/add-media.png">
  <img src="assets/add-media-2.png">
</p>
<p>
  Of course, we need to check it out right? Check it out below:

</p>
<p>
  And there you have it, your very first Source plugin!

          <h2>Sample Plugins</h2>
        </a>
        <p>
          Here are a couple of sample plugins that showcases what you can actually do using XSplit JS Framework. You could check out the source code to get a better understanding on how the plugin works.
        </p>
        <h3><em>Scene Rotator Extension plugin</em></h3>
        <p>
          This plugin demonstrates what you can do on Extension plugins. The Scene Rotator plugin would automatically switch to the specified scenes after the given interval. Please do check out the source code at <a href="https://github.com/xjsframework/scene-rotator" target="_blank">github</a>.
        </p>
        <h3><em>Source Toggler Source plugin</em></h3>
        <p>
          This plugin demonstrates what you can do on Source plugins, specifically on how source plugins modify other item sources' properties. The Source Toggler plugin would allow the user to attach two other sources and then modify its position and rotation properties. Please do check out the source code at <a href="https://github.com/xjsframework/source-toggler" target="_blank">github</a>.
        </p>
        <h3><em>Twitch Chat Viewer via Twitch Chat Popout</em></h3>
        <p>
          This plugin demonstrates a different take on doing plugins. This involves injecting custom javascript and css to style and add configurability to an already existing webpage. Please do check out the source code at <a href="https://github.com/xjsframework/twitch-chat-viewer-popout" target="_blank">github</a>.
